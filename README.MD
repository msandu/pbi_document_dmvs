## **What this doeth**

This should create an RMarkdown generated HTML documentation based on a PBIX tabular model.

The documentation includes:

-   Partitions (M queries etc.)

-   Tables, Columns, Measures

-   Relationships

-   Other special attributes:

    -   Incremental refresh policies

Aim is to give both a tabular and a visual view of the PBIX structure, that acts like a documentation. I'm using RMarkdown because one can build a lot of interactive stuff in it (all tho Power BI would've also been a great solution on its own LOL)
