Would do structure per table:

    Table:
        Parent table
        Partitions used
        Columns
        Relationships

    Object sizing:
        Dimensions in bytes for each table
        Should be a DMV storing this


Next steps:
    
    Create an interactive type of page, that autofilters based on tables used.
