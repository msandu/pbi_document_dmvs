Would do structure per table:

    Table:
        Parent table
        Partitions used:
            Security details
        Columns
        Relationships
        Data samples

    Object sizing:
        Dimensions in bytes for each table
        Should be a DMV storing this




partitions > Table [ Columns, Measures ] Relationships
